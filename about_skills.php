<p>I used C#, HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL with soma Apache when I was a self employed web designer.  HTML and CSS to create the web pages, PHP to make them interactive and SQL create and utilise the back end databases. C# was used to write programs to update and maintain the databases.</p>

<p>During my time with Penguin I was mainly using Vista as a developing language, but I also used MSSQL, ASP and Business Objects at various times.</p>

<p>My skills with Pascal, Cobol and Fortran were gained at University.  After leaving I moved into programming in Delphi as a logical extension of my Pascal skills.  Also in my spare time I worked on C and C++.</p>
